In this zip folder Iâ€™ve included the program as well as the example input file.

>In timberlea, my program is in CSCI3171/assignments/assn4

>In assn4 folder, you'll find a txt file ('Input.txt')

>You may either copy your test input into this txt file, or you may copy your own txt
file with the test inputs using the pathway provided above. Just make sure that if you 
choose to provide your own txt file, please delete the current Input.txt file and then
when you include your own file, name it 'Input.txt' (the code is written to process
an input file with that specific name)

>In the input file, make sure to hit enter after each line, as the code is designed
to absorb "\n"s

>To compile the program, enter: python ./assn4.py

>When you hit enter, the program will process the input file and print the output
