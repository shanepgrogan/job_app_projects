In this zip file should be three documents: this readme file, a python file RuleMining.py, and
a CSV file for input data.

1. Enter the command "python ./RuleMining.py"

2. After hitting enter, you should be prompted for two lines of user input, which
    will appear consecutively: one for minimum support, the second for minimum confidence.
    NOTE: both of these values must be fractional decimals between 0 and 1

3. After hitting enter, a text file will be generated containing the corresponding
    association rules. You may access this file by entering "vim ./Rules.txt" or "cat ./Rules.txt"
